Kevin is the Project Manager for Cool Radio English and Kathrin is the Program Officer for AuSAID.\r\n\r\nThe pilot said something over the intercom in Bahasa Indonesia. I did not understand him. I asked someone sitting near me for a clue. I looked out the window and could see the tires on my side of the plane lowering. I felt a little weak in the knees. I realized I had been holding my breath for a quite a while\r\n\r\n1. From where the writer flew?\r\n\r\n2. Who is Kevin?\r\n\r\n3. Who is Kathrin?\r\n\r\n4.
